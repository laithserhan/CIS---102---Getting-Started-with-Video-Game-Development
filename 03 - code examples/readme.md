# Code Examples and Inspiration
This folder is for examples and ideas for what is expected each week. The goal here is to anticipate some of the needs 

Generally, the assignments will build upon each other. Each week, there are 3 goals:

1. Make explicit some of the assumptions from last week (or basically, things I might have had you do because reasons now need to be explained).
1. Build complexity. This will take the form of adding some new feature.
1. Introduce a new concept either from game design or from programming. 

So the class will slowly get (and sometimes quickly get) more complicated. If you don't understand something, please ask as it will only deepen as time goes on and make your life much harder than it needs to be. The general act of the programmer is searching on google for answers, not knowing answers. Saying you don't know things is perfectly fine and a good sign that you're learning!
