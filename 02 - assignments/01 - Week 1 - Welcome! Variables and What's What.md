This first homework assignment is about getting familiar with the various aspects of PICO-8. The goal then is for you to show me that you understand how to use PICO-8's interface in order to show, rather than tell what you are doing. Remember to name each of your files what they are. You can look at the filenames I used for the gifs here to get a sense of what i'm looking for.

1. Create a GIF of you loading any game from the PICO-8 carts website. 
 
     ![Example](/course%20documents/pics/hw/hw1/loadclip.gif) \\
     The above example is rarer these days as the PICO-8 platform has shifted away from the above method.

2. Create a GIF of you pasting code from a PICO-8 game into the programming interface and running it.
    1. Note that this will require you to find a game that runs without using sprites (This means it does not have anything in the sprite screen but what is there by default. See below.). 

     ![Example](/course%20documents/pics/hw/hw1/ctrlv.gif)

3. Create a GIF of you typing the code, "print('hello world')" and running it. 

    ![Example](/course%20documents//pics//hw/hw1/helloworld.gif)

4. Create a GIF of you navigating the SPLORE menu.

    ![Example](/course%20documents//pics/hw/hw1/splore.gif)

5. Take a screenshot of the PICO-8 folder that contains your .p8 files.

    ![Example](/course%20documents//pics/hw/hw1/folder.PNG)
